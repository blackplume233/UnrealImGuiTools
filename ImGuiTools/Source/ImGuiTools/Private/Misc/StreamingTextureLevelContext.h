 * It manage internally structures used to accelerate the binding between precomputed data and textures,
 * so that there is only one map lookup per texture per level.
 * There is some complexity here because the build data does not reference directly texture objects to avoid hard references
 * which would load texture when the component is loaded, which could be wrong since the build data is built for a specific
 * feature level and quality level. The current feature and quality could reference more or less textures.
 * This requires the logic to not submit a streaming entry for precomputed data, as well as submit fallback data for
 * texture that were referenced in the texture streaming build.
