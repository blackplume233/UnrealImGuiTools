# UnrealImGuiTools
A set of tools and utilities for use with Unreal Engine projects using ImGui.

## Description
This plugin includes tools for use with Unreal Engine projects. It also provides a small framework to make writing your own game specific tool windows a bit more quickly and easily.

The plugin itself does not contain ImGui, but has [segross' UnrealImGui plugin](https://github.com/segross/UnrealImGui) as a dependant plugin. This plugin, segross' plugin, and [Omar Cornut's fantastic Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) are all released under MIT license.
